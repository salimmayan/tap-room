1. Render list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, `Name`, `Brand`, `Price` and `Flavor` are displayed.

2. User can populate and submit a form to add a `New` keg to list.

3. User can click on a button on any keg to see its `Details` page.

4. User can see how many pints are left in a keg. **PS:** A keg is hardcoded to 24 pints for ease of use (so that one can demonstrate emptying of keg).

5. User can click a button next to a keg whenever a pint is sold. Each click will decrease the number of pints left by 1. Once pint hits 0, further reduction is prevented by disabling the button.

6.  `Progress Bar` that gives an indication of Quantity of beverage in a keg.
